# SynaptiCode

## The Living Codebase System

SynaptiCode (SynC) transforms static codebases into adaptive, living ecosystems. Unlike traditional code management systems that treat files as isolated artifacts, SynC establishes a "nervous system" that connects all components, allowing changes to naturally propagate throughout the ecosystem while maintaining developer intent.

### Core Concepts

SynaptiCode operates on biological principles:

- **Code files** function as specialized cells in the system
- **Documentation** serves as sensory organs that interface with the external world
- **Relationships between components** form neural pathways
- **LLM integration** provides the cognitive intelligence
- **Change propagation** mimics nervous system signals

### Key Features

- **Intelligent Relationship Mapping**: Automatically discovers connections between code components
- **Change Impact Analysis**: Predicts how changes will affect related components
- **Adaptation Suggestions**: Generates intelligent updates for affected components
- **Document Sensing**: Keeps documentation fresh with external knowledge
- **Comprehensive Analysis & Overhaul**: Provides aggressive system-wide improvement options

### Getting Started

See the [Architecture Document](./docs/architecture.md) for detailed information about the system design and implementation approach.
