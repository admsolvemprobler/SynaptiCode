# SynaptiCode Architecture

## System Overview

SynaptiCode (SynC) is designed as a biological-inspired system with several interconnected components that work together to create a living codebase ecosystem.

## Core Components

### Neural Network

The core of SynaptiCode is its neural network that establishes connections between code components:

- **Connection Discovery**: Analyzes import statements, function calls, and data flow to map relationships
- **Relationship Strength**: Measures the degree of coupling between components
- **Temporal Memory**: Tracks how relationships evolve over time

### Sensory System

The documentation and external interface components that connect the codebase to the outside world:

- **Documentation Monitors**: Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- **External Knowledge Integration**: Incorporates industry best practices and standards
- **User Interaction Patterns**: Learns from how developers interact with the system

### Cognitive Processing

LLM integration provides the intelligence to process changes and suggest adaptations:

- **Intent Recognition**: Understands developer objectives from changes
- **Impact Analysis**: Predicts effects of changes throughout the ecosystem
- **Adaptation Generation**: Creates appropriate modifications for affected components

### Signal Propagation

The mechanism for transmitting change signals through the ecosystem:

- **Change Detection**: Identifies when components are modified
- **Signal Routing**: Determines which connected components need to be updated
- **Implementation Suggestions**: Provides developers with adaptation options

## Implementation Approach

SynaptiCode is implemented as a combination of:

1. **Static Analysis Tools**: For baseline relationship discovery
2. **Runtime Monitoring**: To capture dynamic relationships
3. **LLM Integration**: For cognitive processing and adaptation generation
4. **Developer Interface**: For presenting insights and suggestions

## Future Directions

- **Self-Healing Capabilities**: Automatic resolution of simple inconsistencies
- **Predictive Development**: Suggesting new features based on system patterns
- **Ecosystem Evolution**: Long-term adaptation to changing requirements
